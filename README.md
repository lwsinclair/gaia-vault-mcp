    "gaia-vault-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "gaia-vault-mcp@latest"],
      "env": {
        "AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING": "your-connection-string-here"
      },
      "disabled": false,
      "autoApprove": []
    }
  }
}
```

#### Add the Gaia Vault server configuration:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gaia-vault-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "gaia-vault-mcp@latest"],
      "env": {
        "AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING": "your-connection-string-here"
